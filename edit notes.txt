Heading to Kyoto? Looking for a more local experience or craving high-end design?
Then consider a visit to Kyoto State Guest House, a place where each detail is meticulously thought-out.
The place creates a vibe that is hard to describe with words.

Before entering the site, you are required to go through an airport-like security check.
You place your belongings and shoes into lockers at the lobby's front entrance.

Aesthetics and techniques developed over 1,200 years have been further honed here.
They create the ultimate setting for Japanese hospitality in today's global society.
